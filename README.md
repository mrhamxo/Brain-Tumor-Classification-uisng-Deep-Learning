# Brain Tumor Classification with VGG19 and Streamlit

This project is a web-based application that classifies MRI images to determine the presence of brain tumors using a deep learning model based on the VGG19 architecture. The interface is built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload an MRI image and receive a prediction.

## Overview

This application uses a pre-trained VGG19 model, fine-tuned with additional custom layers to classify MRI images as having a brain tumor or not. The user interface is created using Streamlit, making it easy to upload images and get instant predictions.

## Features

- **Upload MRI Images**: Users can upload MRI images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- **Real-time Predictions**: The model predicts whether the uploaded image shows a brain tumor.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive, and interactive user experience.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in medical image classification by providing a simple yet powerful tool for brain tumor detection. Leveraging the VGG19 model, the application can assist healthcare professionals in preliminary diagnoses, thereby speeding up the decision-making process. The easy-to-use Streamlit interface makes this technology accessible to a broader audience, including those with limited technical expertise. As AI continues to advance, such applications will play a critical role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving patient outcomes.
